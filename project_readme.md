# Final Project
For your final project, use the skills you've developed in this class to tackle a new problem. For example, you could develop a visualization for a complex dataset, construct a physicalization, visualize an algorithmic process, or run an experiment to explore graphical perception. Be creative and have fun! 

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<h3>Proposal:</h3>
Please submit a preliminary project proposal that outlines your project's motivating problem and concrete workplan describing what you intend to accomplish to Dr. Szafir and Jim Dykes via email by Monday, 4.9 at 11:59pm (please send a single email per group with all group members CC'ed). This will take place of that week's reading assignment. We will provide you with guiding feedback for your project and a set of expectations based on this proposal within 48 hours of receiving your proposal.   

Please note that this is the latest deadline that we would like to see the proposal by. I'd recommend you submit earlier to give yourself more time to work on the final project. 

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
You will be graded on both the artifacts you generate as part of this project and a project write-up. As stated above, expectations for the artifacts will be provided as feedback for your proposal.   

You should approach the write-up like a research paper. It should contain the following sections: 
<ul>
<li>A 1-paragraph abstract that summarizes your motivating problem, what you did, and what you found. </li>
<li>An introduction that describes the motivating problem and why it's interesting or important. </li> 
<li>A related work section that summarizes research related to your project (minimum eight citations). </li>
<li>A detailed description of your project and justifications for any design elements. </li>
<li>A discussion of what you found.</li>
</ul>

The write-up should be a <b>minimum</b> of two pages (including figures and references) using the IEEE VIS Poster Format: http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html

As with prior projects, please also send Danielle and Jim a confidential post-mortem that outlines your roles, how you'd rate your own contribution, and how you'd rate the contributions of your teammates. 

<h2>Submission</h2>
Final projects are due 11:59pm on 5.3; however, you will have a no-cost extension until 5.5 at 11:59pm. Note that due to University grading deadlines, late projects will not be accepted.    


Please upload all deliverables through GitHub Classroom. This includes any code, data, documentation, or write-up. If you have physical artifacts, please either reach out to me to set up an appointment to present your artifacts or submit an explanatory video and/or set of photographs.
