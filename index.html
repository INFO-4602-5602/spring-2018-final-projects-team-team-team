        <p>How does the stock market work, and what are we seeing in a graph? How can we know if we can buy or sell? What do stock technical indicators mean?
        <h2>The stock market</h2>
        <p>The stock market commonly refers to an open exchange wherein people can buy or sell <b>stock</b> of publicly-traded companies. A stock is equity (ownership) in the company. Basically when you buy a stock, you are buying a little slice of that company! Companies sell stock to investors to raise money in exchange for this ownership slice. Usually equity comes with voting rights, and investors can help guide the company towards their vision to earn a reward on their shared vision for the company's future. </p>
        <p>When the market opens each day, the stock price goes up and down according to supply and demand. For example, if lots of people want to buy a stock for a higher price than before, the stock price goes up. A graph of the stock price can show the daily high, daily low, and closing value. The following chart shows the price of Apple Inc's stock (AAPL) for a 30-day period. The middle line shows the closing price, and the high and low are shown as the shaded region. Hover over to see the prices for that day.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, people use the stock market to speculate. That is, they aren't interested in the health of the company and in investing, so much as they are interested in betting if the stock will go up or down. If they bet correctly, they can make massive profit. 
        <p><b>Technical analysis</b> runs equations and statistics on a company's stock price history in order to try to predict which direction it will move. The problem is that historical price</p>
