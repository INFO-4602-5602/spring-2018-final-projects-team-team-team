        <p>How does the stock market work, and what are we seeing in a graph? How can we know if we can buy or sell? What do stock technical indicators mean?
        <h2 id="stock_market">The stock market</h2>
        <p>The stock market commonly refers to an open exchange wherein people can buy or sell <b>stock</b> of publicly-traded companies. A stock is equity (ownership) in the company. Basically when you buy a stock, you are buying a little slice of that company! Companies sell stock to investors to raise money in exchange for this ownership slice. Usually equity comes with voting rights, and investors can help guide the company towards their vision to earn a reward on their shared vision for the company's future. </p>
        <p>When the market opens each day, the stock price goes up and down according to supply and demand. For example, if lots of people want to buy a stock for a higher price than before, the stock price goes up. A graph of the stock price can show the daily high, daily low, and closing value. The following chart shows the price of Apple Inc's stock (AAPL) for a 30-day period. The middle line shows the closing price, and the high and low are shown as the shaded region. Hover over to see the prices for that day.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, people use the stock market to speculate. That is, they aren't interested in the health of the company and in investing, so much as they are interested in betting if the stock will go up or down. If they bet correctly, they can make massive profit.
        <p><b>Technical analysis</b> runs equations and statistics on a company's stock price history in order to try to predict which direction it will move. The problem is that historical price</p>
        <h3 id="tech_inds">Technical Indicators</h3>
        <h4>SMA</h4>
        <p>Simple moving average (SMA) is a statistic of a stock that gives an indication of a time period's trend in the upward or downward direction.  The process of calculating a simple moving average is summing all of the closing prices in a certain time interval and dividing by the number of prices.  It is a value that can be tweaked by analysts in order to smooth out the data.  As the time interval increases, the SMA shows a much smoother representation of the source data whereas decreasing the time interval shows a "closer" representation of the source data.
SMAs are excellent indicators of upward and downward trends in data and analysts employ different trading techniques utilizing SMAs.  One popular trend is the death cross where the fifty day SMA crosses below the two hundred day SMA.  It is considered to indicate a downward trend and analysts are inclined to sell.
</p>
        <h4>EMA</h4>
        <p>Exponential moving average (EMA) is a similar statistic to SMA but more heavily weights recent prices in the average.  In order to calculate an exponential EMA, the SMA is first calculated and used as its initial value.  For each day in the time interval,  a weighting factor is found and a percentage of the last EMA value is added to the current EMA value.
Because of the addition of heavy recent price weights, the EMA is more sensitive to the source data and will not smooth out the data as well as the SMA.
        </p>

        <h4>STOCH</h4>
        <p>Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH) is a statistic that gives analysts an indication of the momentum of a particular stock.  It is calculated by subtracting the lowest price over a time interval from the current close and then dividing this result by the range of the time interval.  A simple moving average over a specified time interval is applied to these percentages to generate the statistic.  This statistic shows when a stock is making large movements in the upward or downward direction.
There are two version of the STOCH statistic: slow and fast.  The fast version is the statistic described above without the simple moving average whereas the slow version implements the smoothing factor (SMA).
        </p>

        <h4>MACD</h4>
        <p>Moving average convergence/divergence is another statistic that gives an indication of momentum.  It does so by showing the relationship between two different moving averages.  The 26-Day EMA is subtracted from the 12-Day EMA and this is the base algorithm to find the MACD statistic of a stock.  To find the MACD signal, an EMA is applied to the MACD statistic.  Analysts plot the both the MACD statistic and the MACD signal on the same plot and check to see where crossovers occur.  When the signal passes above the MACD statistic, it indicates that upward trends are likely in the future.
        </p>
        <h4>RSI</h4>
        <p>Relative strength index is yet another momentum indicator and evaluates how "strong" a stock has performed over a specified interval.  The relative strength is calculated by finding the average gain/loss of a stock's price over the time interval.  The equation to calculate the RSI is presented below.
RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS)
Because RSI values can only range from 0-100, certain values are marked as thresholds to indicate when a stock is being overbought or oversold.  Analysts commonly use the value 70 for this indication.
